# Module 1: Kickstarter

## Overview of Project:

- The Crowfunding is a lists of over 4000 campaigns with the brakdown of the details, such as goals, success, timeline along with dates and categories of each campaign.  Our main goal was analyzing the data and helping Louise -  who wanted to start a campaign to help her play "Fever" with $10,000+ budget. We needed to analyse the Kickstarter file to understand the process from other camaign's  and plan Fever project's success.



## Analysis and Challanges:

- By using conditional formatting we started to customize the worksheet first, in order to refine the visual presentation. 

- In order to do so, we conditionally formatted outcomes to see which projects were successful, which failed along with canceled and live crowdfunds. Then we added a new column 'Percentage Funded' and color coded it from min to max to identify easier.

- As a next step, we helped Louise to set up some incentives  on historical pledge and goal amounts.

- After adding additional columns to review percentage of funded projects and average donations, we decided to  organize the data to view only theater category. By splitting category and subcategories column into two separate columns, we created e a Pivot table.


- We created a chart and saved it as an image to provide for Louse along with out findings when done with analyzing the data. 

- Next, to help Louise to plan her campaign timeline, we decided to focus on the length of fundraising campaigns and understand at what degree it's connected to the campaign's success. Is shorter campaign or longer one more effective? 

- After reviewing the chart and line chart that we created, we noticed that the month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. However, January, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched.


- We decided to update out charts y adding further filters to show only theater and plays' data to be more specific, such as search for unique campaigns and help Louise to narrow down the scope and review most similar campaigns.

- Once we had what we needed, we created pivot tables to review the outcomes based on launch date, and goals and created graphs and charts to review them easily. 





## Results: 

- As a results, from the outcomes Based on Goals chart we noticed that there's higher chance of success if Louise's plans the fever budget somewhere between **15,000 to 19,999** and **May, June** is potentially the best month to launch the "Fever" play, based on the hostoric data that we analysed.
